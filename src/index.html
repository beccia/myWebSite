            <h2>About me</h2>
            
            <p>Small introduction time: I am Federico, originally from Florence, Italy but grown-up in Amsterdam. At the moment living in Haarlem (a smaller but beautiful  historical city very close to Amsterdam). 
                <br/><br/>
                I used to work in a project management role for the Red Cross as I was quite idealistic and really wanted to work for an organization that’s aiding troubled people’s lives, but after a few years I had the feeling of lacking challenge and creativity. After a dev friend said I should look into programming because he thought it’d suit me, I did and it was the best thing I have ever done. 
  After a few months I started my first “real” job as a developer a while back. I love the idea that I can just build things whenever I like (like this simple website).  
                <br/><br/>
                Aside from being a developer, I practice the sweet science of boxing. Floyd Mayweather Jr. is obviously GOAT, special respect for my personal favorite: my man Arturo Gatti (R.I.P.) and among active fighters I like Deontay Wilder, Errol Spence Jr. & GGG. 
               
                I also love me some videogames but I have a special website about these(link is in the footer below) so I won’t elaborate on that too much here, but I do legitimately believe that it is an underestimated medium that besides entertainment & relaxation can prove very beneficial for creative thinking and seeing different perspectives. I often visit the movie theater and Star Wars is the greatest cinematic shit ever  (IV > V > VI > III > II > VII > IX > I = VIII).

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>At the time of writing, I made the jump to software development a little over six months ago and I am really happy that I made that jump and can use my skills creatively for basically whatever I want. Actually the first idea behind this personal page was that I just wanted to try hosting a static website on AWS through S3. The plan is to truly be a great full-stack developer as soon as possible, and to do various interesting projects from there, projects for social value as well as media & entertainment centered projects. 
                <br/><br/>
                There’s (besides my day job as a developer) two things I’m working on. First: a website about videogames, with reviews, articles & news and a game. I’m still working on it and not happy enough to put it online but A link will be placed in the footer below soon. Second:  I’m currently learning to build games in Unity using C# and my first project is a squad based tactical RPG. I’ll post a link when it’s somewhat presentable. As soon as I’m more proficient I’d love to make some stat-heavy rpg’s, dungeon crawlers and something along the lines of what Starfox Lylat Wars on the Nintendo 64 was. But realistically speaking it will probably take a while until any of these will have a minimum viable version. 
                <br/><br/> At the moment I work as a DevOps engineer and I am putting a lot of effort with pleasure to learn more and become a better, more creative  developer.
