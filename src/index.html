            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I am currently 32 years old and living in a small country called The Netherlands, but I’ll keep it videogame related from here on. 

                At 7 years old I got a Game Boy for the holidays, with Wario Land. The music and the world map were full of magic and I loved the hell out of that game. Besides this one, I don’t really remember so many but that’s probably also because I got a SNES shortly after and played mostly on that since.
                
                My most memorable games where the Donkey Kong Country trilogy and Lufia: Rise of the Sinistrals. In my opinions the SNES was glorious because the graphics were at a sweet spot of simple pixely but good looking, and there’s some really amazing video game music in this time. Thinking of the artwork and OST of Yoshi’s Island for example still gives me this warm fuzzy feeling inside. N64. This was Nintendo’s prime for me. Mario 64 was beyond amazing at that time, and to this day Zelda: OO is my all time greatest videogame memory. It looked insanely good the music and artwork were so full of soul and the first time getting out of Kokiri forest, having the Hyrule field theme kick in and seeing this whole world there before you is still the pea feeling of videogames ever. I used to actually set my alarm clock 2 hour earlier to play that shit before school.</p>
